## Gmail Scraper
Grow your database by getting the emails of everyone you've ever emailed, in one click.


## Facebook Scraper

However, getting their data in a format that Facebook accepts, is a challenge. They can spend hours formatting an excel file. Enter The Facebook Custom Audience Tool. Simply upload your .csv or .xls file and download a perfectly formatted list that Facebook will accept and match up to their respective Facebook profiles.
